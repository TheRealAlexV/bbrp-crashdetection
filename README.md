When someone crashes their vehicle, a Sonorancad 911 call is automatically made by a caller called "Automated Crash Detection System" with the street and nearest cross street. 
I can add postal code later. I need to look and see what calls need to be made to get the current postal. 
It also adds a sonoran activity blip to the map at the crash site too.
There are also different accident severity levels and visual effects. 
Small crashes cause you to black out for 3 seconds and make your screen shake for a variable amount of time. 
The worse the accident is the longer the shaking effect lasts(right now the maximum is 30 seconds, but we could do longer/shorter).
